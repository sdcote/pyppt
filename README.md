# Overview

This is a project for my learning Python and the Python-pptx library. It creates a set of presentations from data in CSV files. Images are stored in the `media` directory. 

## The Presentation
The generated presentation decks cover the Continuous Delivery Maturity Model and contain an inventory of continuous delivery practices grouped by each of the 5 categories and several levels: regressive, base, beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert.

## Instructions

Simply run `create.py` and several PowerPoint decks are generated.

The content of the decks is edited in the CSV files.

The template for the presentation is in `template.pptx`. Any PowerPoint presentation can be used as a template.
