Section Header,Intermediate Level Practices,Growing and advancing,These practices are exhibited by teams who deliver consistent quality artifacts
Concept,Testing & Verification,Automatic component tests (isolated),Does the team conduct white-box testing of individual components of the system?
Concept,Testing & Verification,Some automatic acceptance (functional) tests,Does the team perform some tests correlated to individual acceptance criteria?
Concept,Testing & Verification,Automated tests written as part of story development,"As a story or acceptance criteria is being defined, are automated tests written and checked into the code base?"
Concept,Testing & Verification,Maintain test data,Does the team use a known set of test data against which tests are conducted?
