Regressive: Manual testing after development,The only testing is performed by hand after the artifact is created.
Automatic unit tests,Are individual units of source code tested?
Separate test environment,"Are artifacts deployed and tested in a separate, known, stable environment?"
Automatic integration tests,Are tests conducted with the artifact placed in operation with other artifacts?
Test Coverage Analysis,Does the team trach what lines of code are being tested?
Static Code Analysis,"Is code run through scanners to identify bug patterns, security, and quality issues?"
Automatic component tests (isolated),Does the team conduct white-box testing of individual components of the system?
Some automatic acceptance (functional) tests,Does the team perform some tests correlated to individual acceptance criteria?
Automated tests written as part of story development,"As a story or acceptance criteria is being defined, are automated tests written and checked into the code base?"
Maintain test data,Does the team use a known set of test data against which tests are conducted?
Test driven development,Does the team write tests first then code until the tests pass?
Manual performance testing,Does the team test the performance of their artifacts?
Manual security testing,Does the team test the security of their artifacts?
Full automatic acceptance tests,Are all acceptance criteria validated regressively with automated tests?
Behavior driven development,Does the team generate scenario-based tests cases for the application then code until those scenarios complete as expected?
Automatic acceptance tests,Are acceptance tests performed as part of the build and deploy process?
Automatic performance tests,Are performance and load tests performed as part of the build and deploy process?
Automatic security tests,Are security tests performed as part of the build and deploy process?
Adaptive test suites,Do tests change based on the results of other tests?
Risk based manual testing,Does the team perform manual testing only when risk has been identified?
End to end testing,Does the team perform testing of a transaction from start to completion (e.g. order entry to checkout)?
Regression testing,Are all previous tests run against the current artifact in different configurations?
Verify expected business value,Does the team verify that the expected value of a change has been realized by the customer?
Test in production,Can tests be run in the production environment without fear of outage or corruption of data integrity?
Continuous testing pipeline with regression testing,Are all regression tests performed as part of an artifacts build and deploy process?
Defects found and fixed immediately (roll forward),"Are defects prioritized, addressed and deployed immediately without regard to release schedules?"
